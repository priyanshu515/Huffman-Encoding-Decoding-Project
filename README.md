# Huffman-Encoding-Decoding-Project
This code defines the HuffmanCoder class, which implements Huffman coding for data compression and decompression. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses variable-length codes for encoding symbols based on their frequencies. This class includes methods for encoding and decoding text, along with utilities for working with Huffman trees.
